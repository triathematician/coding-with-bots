# Code0, Session1

This is a log of a chat session with ChatGPT, 10-Dec-2022. Some of the responses were truncated for some reason. This was primarily a test to see if I could help it fix its mistakes and get the environment up and running, assuming minimal knowledge. I imagine this might be pretty frustrating if you don't already know how to do it, but some of the boilerplate here might be really nice to generate.

## give me a pom file for using tornadofx 
Here is a sample pom.xml file for a project that uses TornadoFX, a popular JavaFX framework for building desktop applications in Kotlin:
```
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>

</project>
```
This pom.xml file specifies the dependencies and build settings needed to build a Kotlin project that uses TornadoFX. It includes the kotlin-stdlib-jdk8 and tornadofx dependencies, and it uses the Kotlin Maven plugin to compile the Kotlin source code.

To use this pom.xml file, you will need to create a Kotlin file that contains a javafx.stage.Stage subclass and call the launch function from the tornadofx.App class. For example:
```
import tornadofx.*

class MyApp :
```

## where do i put the pom file and my code. can you give me a folder structure?

The pom.xml file should be placed at the root of your project directory, alongside any other project-level files such as the README.md file and the LICENSE file. Your source code and other project files should be organized into a hierarchy of directories within the project directory.

Here is an example of a common directory structure for a Maven-based Kotlin project:
```
my-kotlin-project/
├── pom.xml
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── kotlin/
│   │   │   └── com/
│   │   │       └── example/
│   │   │           └── Main.kt
│   │   └── resources/
│   └── test/
│       ├── kotlin/
│       │   └── com/
│       │       └── example/
│       │           └── MainTest.kt
│       └── resources/
└── target/
    └── ...
```
In this example, the pom.xml file is placed at the root of the project directory, and the source code and resources are organized into the src/main and src/test directories, respectively. The target directory is used by Maven to store the compiled classes and other build artifacts.

You can adjust this directory structure to suit your specific needs and preferences. For example, you can add additional subdirectories within the src directory to organize your source code into different modules or packages. You can also add additional resources directories, such as src/main/assets or src/main/config, to store project-specific assets and configuration files.

Note that this is just one possible directory structure, and there are many other ways to organize your project files depending on your specific requirements. It is important to choose a structure that is logical, consistent, and easy to maintain, and to document your directory structure in the README.md file or other project documentation.

## can you give that to me again, but i want the project name to be "code0" and the default package to be "triath.code0"

Sure, here is an example directory structure for a Maven-based Kotlin project with the project name "code0" and the default package "triath.code0":
```
code0/
├── pom.xml
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── kotlin/
│   │   │   └── triath/
│   │   │       └── code0/
│   │   │           └── Main.kt
│   │   └── resources/
│   └── test/
│       ├── kotlin/
│       │   └── triath/
│       │       └── code0/
│       │           └── MainTest.kt
│       └── resources/
└── target/
    └── ...
```
This directory structure is similar to the one shown in the previous answer, but it has been adjusted to use the project name "code0" and the default package "triath.code0". The Main.kt and MainTest.kt files are located in the triath/code0 subdirectory of the `src/main/kotlin

## can you give me a script to automatically create this folder structure (on windows)
Sure, here is a Windows batch script that you can use to create the directory structure for a Maven-based Kotlin project with the project name "code0" and the default package "triath.code0":
```
@echo off

rem Create the root directory
md code0

rem Create the src directory and subdirectories
md code0\src
md code0\src\main
md code0\src\main\kotlin
md code0\src\main\kotlin\triath
md code0\src\main\kotlin\triath\code0
md code0\src\main\resources
md code0\src\test
md code0\src\test\kotlin
md code0\src\test\kotlin\triath
md code0\src\test\kotlin\triath\code0
md code0\src\test\resources

rem Create the target directory
md code0\target
```
To use this script, save it to a file with a .bat extension (e.g. create-dirs.bat), and run it from the command line. This will create the directory structure for the project, with the root directory being the current working directory.

Note that this script assumes that you are using the Windows command-line interface. If you are using a different operating system, you will need to adjust the script to use the appropriate command-line tools and syntax for your operating system. For example, on macOS or Linux, you can use the mkdir command instead of the md command to create directories.

Additionally, you can customize the script to use a different project name and default package if needed. Simply update the md commands in the script to use the desired directory names. For example, if you want to use the project name "myproject" and the default package "com.example", you can update the md commands as follows:
```
Copy code
@echo off

rem Create the root directory
md myproject

rem
```

## can you use linux commands instead. i'm using git bash
Sure, here is a script that you can use to create the directory structure for a Maven-based Kotlin project with the project name "code0" and the default package "triath.code0", using Linux-style commands:
```
#!/bin/bash

# Create the root directory
mkdir code0

# Create the src directory and subdirectories
mkdir code0/src
mkdir code0/src/main
mkdir code0/src/main/kotlin
mkdir code0/src/main/kotlin/triath
mkdir code0/src/main/kotlin/triath/code0
mkdir code0/src/main/resources
mkdir code0/src/test
mkdir code0/src/test/kotlin
mkdir code0/src/test/kotlin/triath
mkdir code0/src/test/kotlin/triath/code0
mkdir code0/src/test/resources

# Create the target directory
mkdir code0/target
```
This script is similar to the Windows batch script shown in the previous answer, but it uses Linux-style commands (e.g. mkdir instead of md) to create directories. To use this script, save it to a file (e.g. create-dirs.sh) and make it executable with the following command:
```
chmod +x create-dirs.sh
```
You can then run the script with the following command:
```
./create-dirs.sh
```
This will create the directory structure for the project, with the root directory being the current working directory.

As with the Windows batch script, you can customize this script to use a different project name and default package if needed. Simply update the mkdir commands in the script to use the desired directory names. For example, if you want to use the project name "myproject" and the default package "com.example", you can update the mkdir commands as follows:
```
#!/bin/bash

# Create the root directory
mkdir myproject

# Create the src directory and subdirectories
mkdir myproject/src
mkdir myproject/src/main
mkdir myproject/src/main/kotlin
mkdir myproject/src/main/kotlin/com
mkdir myproject/src/main/kotlin/com/example
mkdir myproject/src/main/resources
mkdir myproject/src/test
mkdir myproject/src/test/kotlin
mkdir myproject/src/
```

## where do i put this in my directory structure again?
To use the Main.kt file in your project, you should place it in the src/main/kotlin/triath/code0 directory of your project directory. This is the directory that you specified as the default package for your project when you created the directory structure.

For example, if you are using the directory structure shown in the previous answer, the Main.kt file should be placed at the following location within your project directory:
```
code0/
├── pom.xml
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── kotlin/
│   │   │   └── triath/
│   │   │       └── code0/
│   │   │           └── Main.kt
│   │   └── resources/
│   └── test/
│       ├── kotlin/
│       │   └── triath/
│       │       └── code0/
│       │           └── MainTest.kt
│       └── resources/
└── target/
    └── ...
```
Once you have placed the Main.kt file in the appropriate directory, you can compile and run it using the kotlinc and kotlin commands as shown in the previous answer. When you run the program, it will launch the GUI and display the "Hello World" label.

Note that this is just an example of how you can organize your project files within the directory structure. You can adjust the directory structure and file locations to suit your specific needs and preferences. For example, you may want to add additional subdirectories within the triath/code0 directory to organize your source code into different modules or packages. You can also add additional resources directories, such as src/main/assets or src/main/config, to store project-specific assets and configuration files.

It is important to choose a directory structure that is logical, consistent, and easy to maintain, and to document your directory structure in the README.md file or other project documentation. This will help other developers understand the structure of your project and make it easier for them to navigate and contribute to your project.

## now how do i run it
To run the Main.kt file that you created in the previous answer, you will need to have the Kotlin command-line tools and the TornadoFX library installed on your system. You can then compile and run the program with the following commands:
```
kotlinc Main.kt -cp tornadofx.jar
kotlin -cp .;tornadofx.jar triath.code0.Main
```
The first command uses the kotlinc command to compile the Main.kt file, specifying the tornadofx.jar library on the classpath. The second command uses the kotlin command to run the triath.code0.Main class, again specifying the tornadofx.jar library on the classpath.

You should run these commands from the command line, in the root directory of your project (i.e. the directory that contains the pom.xml file). This will ensure that the kotlinc and kotlin commands can find the Main.kt file and the tornadofx.jar library, and that the output files (e.g. the compiled .class files) are generated in the correct locations.

Here is an example of how you might run these commands:
```
> cd code0
> kotlinc Main.kt -cp tornadofx.jar
> kotlin -cp .;tornadofx.jar triath.code0.Main
```
In this example, the cd command is used to change the current working directory to the root directory of the project (i.e. the code0 directory). The kotlinc and kotlin commands are then run from this directory to compile and run the Main.kt file.

When you run the program, it will launch the GUI and display the "Hello World" label. You can then close the GUI by clicking on the "X" button in the top-right corner of the window.

Note that the exact commands and syntax for running the program may vary depending on your specific system configuration and the version of the Kotlin command-line tools and the TornadoFX library that you are using. You may need to adjust the classpath and other options as needed to run the program successfully on your system. For more information and detailed instructions on using the kotlinc and kotlin commands, you can refer to the Kotlin documentation and tutorials.

## can i run it using maven instead
Yes, you can use Maven to compile and run the Main.kt file that you created in the previous answers. This will allow you to use Maven's build automation and dependency management capabilities to build and run your project, and to manage the project's dependencies (including the TornadoFX library) more easily.

To run the Main.kt file using Maven, you will first need to create a pom.xml file that defines your project and its dependencies. Here is an example pom.xml file that you can use for a Maven-based Kotlin project that uses TornadoFX:
```
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

  <groupId>triath.code0</groupId>
  <artifactId>code0</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>

  <properties>
    <kotlin.version>1.4.21</kotlin.version>
    <tornadofx.version>1.7.20</tornadofx.version>
  </properties>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>
      <artifactId>kotlin-stdlib-jdk8</artifactId>
      <version>${kotlin.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>no.tornado</groupId>
      <artifactId>tornadofx</artifactId>
      <version>${tornadofx.version}</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <build>
    <sourceDirectory>src/main/kotlin</sourceDirectory>
    <testSourceDirectory>src/test/kotlin</testSourceDirectory>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>
        <artifactId>kotlin-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${kotlin.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>compile</id>
            <phase>compile</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>compile</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
          <execution>
            <id>test-compile</id>
            <phase>test-compile</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>test-compile</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
This pom.xml file defines the basic properties of the project (e.g. the group ID, artifact ID, and version), as well as the dependencies that the project needs in order to compile and run correctly. In this case, the project depends on the kotlin-stdlib-jdk8 and tornadofx libraries. The version numbers for these dependencies are defined as properties

## lol, i have the maven pom file already (you gave it to me, remember?) i just want to be able to compile the code using maven, and then run the code using java instead of kotlin.

Sure, you can use Maven to compile the Main.kt file and then run the resulting compiled class file using the java command. To do this, you will need to have Maven and the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

First, you will need to make sure that your pom.xml file is set up correctly to build and run your project. You can use the pom.xml file that I provided in the previous answer, or you can modify it to suit your specific project needs. For example, you may want to adjust the version numbers for the Kotlin and TornadoFX dependencies, or add additional dependencies for other libraries that your project uses.

Once you have a valid pom.xml file, you can use the following Maven commands to build and run your project:
```
mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="triath.code0.Main"
```
The first command, mvn compile, uses Maven to compile the source code for your project. This will compile the Main.kt file and any other source files that your project uses, and generate the compiled class files in the target/classes directory.

The second command, mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="triath.code0.Main", uses Maven to run the triath.code0.Main class using the java command. This will launch the GUI and display the "Hello World" label, just as it did when you ran the program using the kotlinc and kotlin commands.

You can run these commands from the command line, in the root directory of your project (i.e. the directory that contains the pom.xml file). This will ensure that Maven can find the pom.xml file and the source code for your project, and that the output files (e.g. the compiled .class files) are generated in the correct locations.

Here is an example of how you might run these commands:
```
> cd code0
> mvn compile
> mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="triath.code0.Main"
```
In this example, the cd command is used to change the current working directory to the root directory of the project (i.e. the code0 directory). The mvn compile and mvn exec:java commands are then run from this directory to compile and run the Main.kt file.

When you run the program, it will launch the GUI and display the "Hello World" label. You can then close the GUI by clicking on the "X" button in the top-right corner of the window.

Note that the exact commands and syntax for building and running the program may vary depending on your specific system configuration and the version of Maven, the JDK, and the other libraries that you are using. You may need to adjust the classpath and other options as needed to run the program successfully on your system. For more information and detailed instructions on using Maven and the `java

## it looks like there's a dependency issue. when i try to compile, it says it can't find the javafx libraries. can you help?

It sounds like you are encountering a dependency issue when trying to compile the Main.kt file using Maven. This may be because the pom.xml file that I provided in the previous answer does not include the necessary dependencies for the JavaFX libraries, which are required by the TornadoFX library.

To fix this issue, you will need to add the appropriate dependencies for the JavaFX libraries to your pom.xml file. Here is an example of how you might do this:
```
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>
    <artifactId>kotlin-stdlib-jdk8</artifactId>
    <version>${kotlin.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
    <artifactId>javafx-controls</artifactId>
    <version>14.0.1</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
    <artifactId>javafx-fxml</artifactId>
    <version>14.0.1</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>no.tornado</groupId>
    <artifactId>tornadofx</artifactId>
    <version>${tornadofx.version}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
In this example, the pom.xml file includes additional dependencies for the javafx-controls and javafx-fxml libraries, which are required by the TornadoFX library. These dependencies are defined using the org.openjfx group ID and the javafx-controls and javafx-fxml artifact IDs, and they specify the version 14.0.1 of the libraries.

You can add these dependencies to your pom.xml file and then try to compile the Main.kt file again using the mvn compile command. This should resolve the dependency issue and allow you to compile the file successfully.

Once you have successfully compiled the Main.kt file, you can then use the `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="triath.code`

## thanks, that seemed to fix it. now when i try to execute the main class, it says "no such method" and can't seem to find Main.main
It sounds like you are encountering another error when trying to run the Main.kt file using the mvn exec:java command. This error, "no such method", indicates that the java command is unable to find the main method in the Main class.

There are a few potential reasons why this error may occur. One possibility is that the Main.kt file does not contain a main method, or that the main method is not defined correctly. In Kotlin, the main method is the entry point for a program, and it must have a specific signature in order for the program to run correctly. Here is an example of a valid main method in Kotlin:
```
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  // Code for the main method goes here
}
```
In this example, the main method is a fun (function) that takes an Array<String> as its only argument. This argument represents the command-line arguments passed to the program when it is run. Inside the body of the main method, you can include any code that you want to execute when the program starts.

If your Main.kt file does not contain a main method with this signature, or if it contains errors or typos in the method definition, then the java command will not be able to find the main method and you will get the "no such method" error.

Another possibility is that the classpath is not set up correctly, and the java command is not able to find the compiled Main.class file. In this case, you may need to adjust the classpath and other options when running the mvn exec:java command, in order to ensure that the java command can find the compiled class file and the other dependencies that your project needs

## okay, can you give me a main function that launches my tornadofx application
Sure, here is an example of a main method that you can use to launch a TornadoFX application:
```
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  launch<MyApp>()
}
```
In this example, the main method uses the launch function from the TornadoFX library to launch the application. The launch function takes a class object for the application as its argument, and it starts the application by creating an instance of the class and calling its start method.

In this case, the launch function is called with a type parameter of MyApp, which specifies the class object for the application. This should be the class that extends the App class from the TornadoFX library, and it should contain the code for your application's GUI and other components. For example, you might have a class like this:
```
class MyApp : App(MainView::class)
```
In this case, the MyApp class extends the App class and specifies the MainView class as its primary view. The MainView class should contain the code for the main window of your application, including the layout and components for the GUI.

Once you have defined the MyApp class and the MainView class, you can use them in the main method to launch the application. When you run the program, the main method will call the launch function and create an instance of the MyApp class, which will then start the application and display the main window.

Note that this is just a general example of how you might use the main method and the launch function to start a TornadoFX application. The exact details of your implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project and the design of your GUI and other components. For more information and detailed instructions on using the main method and the launch function, you can refer to the TornadoFX documentation and tutorials.

## my app was called "Main", but i think i can figure it out. :)
Ah, I see. If your application class is called Main instead of MyApp, then you will need to update the main method and the launch function to use the correct class name. Here is an example of how you might do this:
```
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  launch<Main>()
}
```
In this example, the main method uses the launch function to start the application by creating an instance of the Main class. This class should extend the App class from the TornadoFX library, and it should contain the code for your application's GUI and other components.

For example, if your Main class extends the App class and specifies the MainView class as its primary view, then the main method will create an instance of the Main class, which will then create an instance of the MainView class and display the main window of your application.

Again, this is just a general example of how you might use the main method and the launch function to start a TornadoFX application. The exact details of your implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project and the design of your GUI and other components. For more information and detailed instructions, you can refer to the TornadoFX documentation and tutorials.

## yep. now it says the jvm target 1.8 isn't compatible with jvm target 1.6
It sounds like you are encountering an error when trying to run the Main.kt file using the mvn exec:java command. This error, "jvm target 1.8 isn't compatible with jvm target 1.6", indicates that there is a mismatch between the version of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that you are using to run the program and the version of the JVM that the program is compiled for.

In this case, it seems that your program is compiled for JVM 1.8, but you are trying to run it using JVM 1.6. This is causing a compatibility issue, because JVM 1.8 is not backward-compatible with JVM 1.6. This means that programs compiled for JVM 1.8 may not be able to run on JVM 1.6, or on older versions of the JVM.

To fix this issue, you will need to make sure that you are using a compatible version of the JVM to run your program. If possible, you should use JVM 1.8 or a later version to run the program, as this will ensure that it is compatible with the version of the JVM that your program is compiled for.

If you are using Maven to build and run your program, you can specify the version of the JVM to use in the pom.xml file. Here is an example of how you might do this:
```
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.8.0</version>
      <configuration>
        <source>1.8</source>
        <target>1.8</target>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```
In this example, the pom.xml file includes a maven-compiler-plugin configuration that specifies the source and target versions for the JVM. The source version specifies the version of the JVM that the source code is written for, and the target version specifies the version of the JVM that the compiled code is intended for.

In this case, both the source and target versions are set to 1.8, which means that the program is compiled for JVM 1.8. If you are using a compatible version of the JVM to run the program (i.e. JVM 1.8 or later), then this should resolve the compatibility issue and allow you to run the program successfully.

Note that the exact configuration and syntax for the maven-compiler-plugin may vary depending on your specific project requirements and the version of Maven that you are using. You may need to adjust the source and target versions as needed to match the version of the JVM that you are using to run the program. For more information and detailed instructions on using the maven-compiler-plugin, you can refer to the Maven documentation.

## it's still giving me issues. the specific error is "Cannot inline bytecode built with JVM target 1.8 into bytecode that is being built with JVM target 1.6"
It sounds like you are still encountering issues when trying to run the Main.kt file using the mvn exec:java command. This error, "Cannot inline bytecode built with JVM target 1.8 into bytecode that is being built with JVM target 1.6", indicates that there is a mismatch between the version of the JVM that you are using to run the program and the version of the JVM that the program is compiled for.

In this case, it seems that your program is compiled for JVM 1.8, but you are trying to run it using JVM 1.6. As I mentioned in the previous answer, this is causing a compatibility issue, because JVM 1.8 is not backward-compatible with JVM 1.6. This means that programs compiled for JVM 1.8 may not be able to run on JVM 1.6, or on older versions of the JVM.

To fix this issue, you will need to make sure that you are using a compatible version of the JVM to run your program. If possible, you should use JVM 1.8 or a later version to run the program, as this will ensure that it is compatible with the version of the JVM that your program is compiled for.

If you are using Maven to build and run your program, you can specify the version of the JVM to use in the pom.xml file. Here is an example of how you might do this:
```
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.8.0</version>
      <configuration>
        <source>1.8</source>
        <target>1.8</target>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```
In this example, the pom.xml file includes a maven-compiler-plugin configuration that specifies the source and target versions for the JVM. The source version specifies the version of the JVM that the source code is written for, and the target version specifies the version of the JVM that the compiled code is intended for.

In this case, both the source and target versions are set to 1.8, which means that the program is compiled for JVM 1.8. If you are using a compatible version of the JVM to run the program (i.e. JVM 1.8 or later), then this should resolve the compatibility issue and allow you to run the program successfully.

Note that the exact configuration and syntax for the maven-compiler-plugin may vary depending on your specific project requirements and the version of Maven that you are using. You may need to adjust the source and target versions as needed to match the version of the JVM that you are using to run the program. For more information and detailed instructions on using the maven-compiler-plugin, you can refer to the Maven documentation.

## how do i check what version of the jvm i'm running?
To check the version of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that you are using, you can use the java command from the command line. This command is included in the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is a set of tools and libraries for developing Java applications.

To check the version of the JVM, follow these steps:

Open a command-line interface, such as a terminal window or command prompt, on your computer.

Type the java command and press Enter. This will run the java command and display a list of options and arguments that you can use with it.

Type the -version option and press Enter. This will run the java command with the -version option, which will display the version of the JVM that you are using. For example, you might see output like this:
```
java version "1.8.0_241"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_241-b07)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.241-b07, mixed mode)
```
In this example, the version of the JVM is 1.8.0_241. This indicates that you are using JVM 1.8, update 241. The exact version number may vary depending on the specific version of the JVM that you are using.

Note that the -version option is case-sensitive, so you must type it exactly as shown (i.e. with a lowercase -v) in order for it to work correctly. You can also use the -v or --version option instead of -version, if you prefer. These options are equivalent and will display the same information.

For more information and detailed instructions on using the java command to check the version of the JVM, you can refer to the Java documentation and tutorials. You can also use the -help option with the java command to display a list of all available options and arguments.

## i fixed it but i had to add a jvmtarget to the kotlin maven plugin instead of just the maven compiler plugin
Ah, I see. It sounds like you were able to resolve the compatibility issue between the version of the JVM that you are using to run the program and the version of the JVM that the program is compiled for. This is good news!

In this case, it seems that you were able to fix the issue by specifying the jvmtarget in the kotlin-maven-plugin configuration in the pom.xml file. This is an alternative approach to using the maven-compiler-plugin configuration that I mentioned in the previous answer.

Here is an example of how you might use the kotlin-maven-plugin to specify the jvmtarget in the pom.xml file:
```
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>
      <artifactId>kotlin-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.3.72</version>
      <configuration>
        <jvmTarget>1.8</jvmTarget>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```
In this example, the pom.xml file includes a kotlin-maven-plugin configuration that specifies the jvmtarget as 1.8. This means that the program will be compiled for JVM 1.8, and it should be able to run on any compatible version of the JVM (i.e. JVM 1.8 or later).

If you are using a compatible version of the JVM to run the program, then this configuration should resolve the compatibility issue and allow you to run the program successfully.

Note that the exact configuration and syntax for the kotlin-maven-plugin may vary depending on your specific project requirements and the version of Maven and Kotlin that you are using. You may need to adjust the jvmtarget value as needed to match the version of the JVM that you are using to run the program. For more information and detailed instructions on using the kotlin-maven-plugin, you can refer to the Kotlin documentation and tutorials.

## we're almost there. now when i try to launch the gui with `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="triath.code0.Main"` it says "no such method: triath.code0.Main.main(String[])void/invokeStatic: triath.code0.Main.main([Ljava/lang/String;)". I do have a main method defined in Main.kt

It sounds like you are encountering an error when trying to run the Main.kt file using the mvn exec:java command. This error, "no such method: triath.code0.Main.main(String[])void/invokeStatic: triath.code0.Main.main(java/lang/String;)", indicates that the mvn exec:java command is unable to find the main method in the triath.code0.Main class.

In this case, there are a few possible reasons why the mvn exec:java command might be unable to find the main method in the Main class. Here are some possible causes and solutions:

The main method is not defined in the Main class. If the main method is not defined in the Main class, or if it is defined in a different class, then the mvn exec:java command will not be able to find it. To fix this issue, you will need to make sure that the main method is defined in the Main class, and that it is defined correctly.

The main method is not public. In order for the mvn exec:java command to be able to access the main method, it must be defined as a public method. If the main method is not defined as a public method, then the mvn exec:java command will not be able to find it. To fix this issue, you will need to make sure that the main method is defined as a public method in the Main class.

The main method is not static. In order for the mvn exec:java command to be able to access the main method, it must be defined as a static method. If the main method is not defined as a static method, then the mvn exec:java command will not be able to find it. To fix this issue, you will need to make sure that the main method is defined as a static method in the Main class.

Here is an example of how the main method might be defined in the Main class to fix this issue:
```
class Main: App() {
  companion object {
    @JvmStatic
    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
      launch<Main>()
    }
  }
}
```
In this example

### thank you, i put the main method inside the companion object, and it works now.
You're welcome! I'm glad that the solution I provided was able to help you resolve the issue with the mvn exec:java command. It sounds like you were able to fix the issue by defining the main method inside the companion object in the Main class. This is correct, and it should allow the mvn exec:java command to find and execute the main method correctly.

In Kotlin, the companion object is a special type of object that is associated with a class. It can be used to define static methods and properties that are associated with the class, and which can be accessed without an instance of the class. In this case, the main method is defined inside the companion object in the Main class, so it is defined as a static method that can be accessed without an instance of the Main class.

By defining the main method inside the companion object, you are also able to use the @JvmStatic annotation to make the main method visible to the JVM. This is necessary because the mvn exec:java command is a Java command, and it is executed by the JVM. The @JvmStatic annotation allows the JVM to find and execute the main method in the Main class, even though it is defined inside the companion object in a Kotlin file.
